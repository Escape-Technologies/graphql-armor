# @escape.tech/graphql-armor-block-field-suggestions

This plugin will disable the suggestions in a GraphQL query.

GraphQL suggestions are messages (`Did you mean ...`) that help you adjusting your query.

This can lead to a Schema leak even if the introspection is disabled.

## Installation

```bash
# npm
npm install @escape.tech/graphql-armor-block-field-suggestions

# yarn
yarn add @escape.tech/graphql-armor-block-field-suggestions
```
