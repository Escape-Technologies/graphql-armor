# Determinate plugin thresholds

We recommend [GraphQL Inspector](https://github.com/kamilkisiela/graphql-inspector) to help you determinate the thresholds to use.

This tool is capable of analyzing your schema and generate useful metrics helping you to monitor your limits.

> Refer to [GraphQL Inspector audit](https://the-guild.dev/graphql/inspector/docs/essentials/audit).
