# @escape.tech/graphql-armor-types

## 0.1.0

### Minor Changes

- c16a2bb: Created a new package dedicated to typing
- c16a2bb: Feat(plugins)/provide-custom-configuration-callbacks

  ```
  {
    onAccept: [],
    onReject: [],
    throwRejection: bool,
  }
  ```

  - Granted the ability to choose whenever you want to throw or not.
  - Introduced callbacks that can be runned before reject the query, for observability purposes.

  - added devDependencies to @escape.tech/graphql-armor-types
